Well, my name is David (I've always had the same nickname - [@davidjguru](https://twitter.com/davidjguru){:target="_blank"}) and I'm  working at Rojomorgan, a digital consulting agency for projects based on Drupal technology. PHP, MySQL, Apache ... some CSS, some javascript ... sitebuilding ... and so on and so on ...

This is my own sketchbook for the things that I'm testing in my environments. I hope you like it and there is something that might interest you.
