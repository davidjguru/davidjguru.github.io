![Yeah. It's me]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/davidjguru_child_its_me_300x409.jpg) My name is David and I was born in Seville, Andalusia, many years ago. **TL;DR:** This is my little personal site, just for fast and short content related with Drupal. You can read more extensive articles on my other website [The Russian Lullaby](https://www.therussianlullaby.com) -I would like to leave this github page only for snippets and short tips-.  

**MORE:** My primary spoken language is Western - Andalusian, a mixed variant of Spanish (Castilian) and ancient Arabic sounds of Al-Andalus (the old name of Andalusia). 
How is this possible?...I recommend you see / enjoy this video with English subtitles to understand it better: [The keys of the memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeUEQWhLgtg){:target="_blank"}.


Apart from this, I'm writing in Spanish (Castillian) and sometimes also in English -as you can see in this blog-. 
I am interested in natural languages as a sign of diversity and a way of respecting other cultures and identities. 
Because of this I try to learn a bit of Catalan or Euskara, the language of the basque people. I also have another blog about Drupal written in Spanish with other content and texts (not directly translated from here) if it is more comfortable for you to read in Spanish. [It's here, in Medium](https://medium.com/@davidjguru){:target="_blank"}.

I'm working as Drupal Senior Developer in [Minsait - Indra](https://www.minsait.com/en) and I have previously been part of other companies such as [Ymbra](https://www.ymbra.com/){:target="_blank"} as Drupal Senior Developer or previously in [Solucionex // SLX](https://www.solucionex.com/){:target="_blank"}, an agency very focused on Software Development using Symfony and Drupal. In my daily work all the workmates we're working in a remote way, so this let me working from different cities and places. And this makes me very, very happy  :-)  
The previous years I was working as Technical Director at Everis (they called it 'Centers Leader Specialist' or so) for the development of projects based on Drupal, involved with a team of 20 people working from Seville. I designed training plans, and I designed the on-boarding processes for PHP-Drupal developers, supervising projects, and I was doing software architecture and development. I'm a [facilitator](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/es/diccionario/ingles/facilitator){:target="_blank"} whose main concern is how to advance the people who are part of my team: that is my [leitmotiv](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/es/diccionario/ingles/leitmotiv){:target="_blank"}.  

I have been linked to Drupal since 2011 (approximately). I've always had the same nickname - [@davidjguru](https://twitter.com/davidjguru){:target="_blank"} and you can see here my own Drupal.org profile: [https://www.drupal.org/u/davidjguru](https://www.drupal.org/u/davidjguru){:target="_blank"}. Now I'm doing digital consulting for Drupal - based projects. PHP, MySQL(MariaDB), Apache, NGINX, Composer, Drush, Drupal Console, Drupal Code Generator, Docker, DDEV... some CSS, some JavaScript ... sitebuilding ... and so on and so on ...
