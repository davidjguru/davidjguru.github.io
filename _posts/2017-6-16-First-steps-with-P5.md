title: First steps with the P5.js library 
---

A few days ago I attended a talk given by Esperanza Moreno [@_mimina_](https://twitter.com/_mimina_), architect, researcher and developer. She's developing applications that allows connect musical file (metadata) with renderings and musical remixes, a visual and auditory show called "Antropoloops" [See their website](http://antropoloops.tumblr.com/) quite powerful.

During her talk while explaining Processing and P5, Esperanza was doing live practical exercises programming applications with elemental shapes, drawing with functions and showing their results in real time. I liked a lot of things about his talk and the used bookstores: didactics, examples and the enormous visual potential that could be used to teach programming with simple functions and interesting drawings.

 I did not know this Javascript library, so I was researching and found some resources and information available to start practicing.
