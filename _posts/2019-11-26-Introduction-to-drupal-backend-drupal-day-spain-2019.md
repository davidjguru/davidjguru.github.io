I write these lines (or I start them) just as I return from Drupal Day Spain 2019, which this year took place in the city of Zaragoza. I'm typing while I recreate in my head various anecdotes, details, conversations and above all, learning. 

It has been a very enriching meeting and I liked it very much from a technical point of view, but now I want to write mainly about what has been my personal contribution to the encounter: an introduction workshop to the backend of Drupal 8.

This year, the event has been organized in the city of Zaragoza, capital of the "autonomous community" (region with self-government in the Spanish state) of Aragon, in the north of the country. 
A very beautiful city that in winter accentuates even more its attractiveness: [Take a look of Zaragoza in the Flickr albums of the City Council](https://www.flickr.com/photos/zaragozaturismo/albums/72157662195031429).
