I recently acquired the book "Local web development with DDEV explained" written by Mike Anello  and I'd like to share my thoughts on that here.
So, Do you develop projects based on Drupal? do you know the DDEV tool for building environments? these may be important motivations, but there are more reasons why Mike Anello's book could be interesting for you...

## 1- Introduction

As I have already mentioned on other occasions, I was lucky enough to learn about this tool from a friend. He told me about DDEV and he also told me about Randy Fay, one of the staff behind the development team of the tool. With the first thing (using the tool) I trieda lot and with the second I worked by delegated criteria: if a friend spoke so well about Randy Fay, then I had to pay attention. That's how I started to test DDEV in my environments and projects and I followed Randy.

**This is important:** there is no good technology without good people operating behind it and DDEV is a very, very rich project in its community and development. That's why (I guess) the tool and the Human team (here) is very related. Follow them.

Since I started using DDEV I have had time to learn some things, writing some articles and even attend some sessions on DDEV (like this one at Drupal Camp Spain 2019). After all this time, I can tell you that using DDEV has made me happy and being able to convince teams to align environments using DDEV has made me even happier. Now I am writing a long article about the tool in Spanish (my primary language) and I have been lucky enough to be able to read the book that Michael Anello has written on the subject.

As you can see, I have some relationship with the topic and now I'm writing these lines to present and evaluate the book.

## 2- The Book
![Image of DDEV explained]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/davidjguru_drupal_8_books_ddev_explained_one.png)

The fact that this book has a lot of experience behind it is something you can see, and a lot. Not in vain it is written by Mike Anello, one of the thinking heads behind Drupal Easy, a company with a lot of experience in training processes in general and Drupal in particular. But it is also edited by OSTraining, another organization strongly focused on training, and this is a quite important plus.

I can say -_without fear of being wrong_-, that this is the most consistent handbook on technology I have read recently, and by this I mean that any technological proposal should consist of an intuitive sequence:

1. **Problem** / Need that comes to solve.
2. **Analysis** of the situation.
3. **Proposal** (technical solution).

Well, this is the sequence that we normally do not find in the _anti-teaching_ of technology. And this is where the construction of this book shines.


## 3- Recommendations

![Tips from DDEV explained]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/davidjguru_drupal_8_books_ddev_explained_two.png)

The book has a very specific target...
* **Do you feel the irremediable existential void when you are solving configuration problems in the project-environment relationship for several days?**  
Well, this book is for you.
* **Do you think you can convince your team of the importance of aligning environments around an easy, simple, agile and intuitive solution?**  
This book is also for you.
* **Do you think you need to provide evidence to an _old-school_ manager to consider more productive the adoption of this kind of tools?**  
  Don't hesitate, this is your book.

You can take it in hand and hold it up in front of your managers as if it were Mao's little red book. For us, it will be like that. I assure you.

And remember: **"Code flows up, Data flows down"**. Always.
