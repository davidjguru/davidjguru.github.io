I am preparing notes for a draft that will be a book about migration processes
made with Drupal and its Migrate API. It is expected to be released in June 2020 and the work of collecting, experimenting and articulating the content is being quite extensive.
As there are still some months left for the launch, in order not to lose the mental sanity and to be able to give partial sense to these tasks, I have thought to publish here some small posts derived from the working notes.

This way I will be able to give something useful to the complementary notes and if the COVID-19 attacks me before seeing the book come out, at least I will have shared something before.
