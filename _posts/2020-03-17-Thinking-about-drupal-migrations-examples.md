As I said in the previous post, during these months I will be playing with 
migrations, preparing some cases for a future (I hope) book. Well, during these 
days of confinement, I intend to continue with small articles around here to 
show experiences related to migrations.

In the former post, I was writing about migrations in Drupal from a point of 
view based in the look for a tool-box, just a set of basic resources in order to
 focusing a migration. 
 
 There's a lot of information to process about it and some more concepts, 
 technics and tactics to resolving a migration, you can be sure. So this month 
 I want to write something that allows me play with migrations, maybe more 
 practical than theorical.
