Hi to everyone! I'm working on a personal website for technical stuff, out of the corporative site and other blogs where I write content in spanish. I have found this piece of software with easy setting and deployment options from Github, from a fork of a repository for light websites with  Jekyll and some gems over Ruby, so I'll try. A bit of Vim, Git in local and push to Github.
