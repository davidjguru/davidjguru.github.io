Last Friday I had to perform several code debugging to review several use cases based on the interconnections between a data bus and a Drupal installation. It has been a long time since I debugged REST and in this time, I have gone from using Drupal in a custom LAMP / Docker environment to working only and exclusively with DDEV based Drupal environments.

So "remodeling" at that level the work stack has made me want to take some notes, for the joy of using something as easy as DDEV for the development in a local environment.  This will be an article about configurations for testing REST queries from Postman while debugging requests from the Drupal side connecting Xdebug between PHPStorm and DDEV.
