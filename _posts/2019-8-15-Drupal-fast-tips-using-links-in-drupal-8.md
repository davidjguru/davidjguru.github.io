The first thing I need to clarify is that we are not going to talk about
***"using links"*** in Drupal 8. We're actually going to talk about how to
 build 
custom links in Drupal 8.  Well, I wanted to write about this but because of
the character limitation of the title string I used that form. 
So keep reading if you want to know how to build links programmatically in Drupal 8. 
Do you follow me?
