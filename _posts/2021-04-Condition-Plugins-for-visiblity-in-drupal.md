Following on from my previous post about "200 Linux commands for everyday life" that I published a few months ago -September 2020, [here](https://davidjguru.github.io/blog/200-linux-commands-for-everyday-life)-, so today I want to share another small article about little everyday utilities. The previous post had a more extensive (and intense) feedback than when I'm writing about Drupal, so this has invited me to think that maybe (just maybe) it could be useful content for someone.
