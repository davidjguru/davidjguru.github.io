Following on from my previous post about "200 Linux commands for everyday life" that I published a few months ago -September 2020, [here](https://davidjguru.github.io/blog/200-linux-commands-for-everyday-life)-, so today I want to share another small article about little everyday utilities. The previous post had a more extensive (and intense) feedback than when I'm writing about Drupal, so this has invited me to think that maybe (just maybe) it could be useful content for someone.

From the [Condition Plugin System](https://www.drupal.org/node/1961370), as was described in 2013: 

> _"To implement a condition in a module create a class in {module}/src/Plugin/Condition/{ConditionName}.php and extend ConditionPluginBase (which implements ConditionInterface). The class must also declare a plugin annotation in its docblock comment."_  

From the [Plugin Contexts Definition](https://www.drupal.org/docs/drupal-apis/plugin-api/plugin-contexts):  

> _"Sometimes plugins require another object in order to perform their primary operation. This is known as plugin context. Using a practical example, almost all condition plugins require a context. Let's look at the NodeType condition's plugin definition [...] The context_definitions key stores an array of named context definitions the condition requires in order to perform its "evaluate()" method."_
