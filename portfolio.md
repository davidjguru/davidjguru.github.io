Sevilla4Real is a tourism company focused on the city of Seville. It was put in our hands for a consulting process of analysis, design and implementation of a new visual approach and a new platform that better covered its objectives.
Sevilla4Real came to us motivated to know us from our positive reputation in our direct environment in terms of working with platforms for tourism companies based on Drupal.

The Regional Government of the “Autonomous Community” (Well,It’s the original title in Spanish) of Andalusia in southern Spain decides to create a platform to register, index and locate all flamenco professionals and their artistic productions.
The Regional Government of Andalusia chose Rojomorgan as the favorite agency to design and build the project: to create an online platform for the search of everything related to Flamenco.
